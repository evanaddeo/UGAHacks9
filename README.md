# UGAHacks 9 Project
#### Evan Addeo & Kaitlyn Back

The purpose of this project is to help out our peer college students and any others who are tired of scraping the internet for recipes that end up being expensive, contain ingredients you don't like, and aren't even that good! PlatePerfect is the solution for customizable recipe suggestions, ingredient provisions, and nutrition information.

- We utilized Python, JavaScript, React Framework, Flask Framework, a MySQL Database, Git & GitHub, Node.js, Next.js, npm, and the Spoonacular API
- One of our primary problems was that neither of us had much experience at all with a Python virtual environment, so we faced a lot of issues regarding dependency management and incompatible versions, etc. We overcame this by using online resources to find people with similar issues and that had previously resolved them.
